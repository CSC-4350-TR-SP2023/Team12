	<p>Welcome to the annual GSU poster judging competition!</p>
	<br>
	<p>On this site, you the judges will be able to access the students submitted posters and give them a rating.</p>
	<p>These students have worked relentelessly on these posters all year long so they will be very complex and interesting!</p>
	<br>
	<p>The rating system will be divided into PHD students, Masters students, and Undergrad students so please remember to rate with discretion.</p>
	<p>The rating system will also be going in the range of 1-10 and will show the poll results at the end.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Please click the "Judge Log-in" button at the top to begin!</p>
